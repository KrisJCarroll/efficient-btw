        This is a generic Step element. It is the most basic type of Step and does not feature autocompletion
        detection. This step should only be used if none of the later specific Steps address the actions
        occurring in the guide. These steps will require the user to manually mark them as completed to progress
        the guide to the next step.
        Required sub-elements:
            * <completed> - a flag to determine if a step has been completed or not, this should usually always be
                            false when writing a guide
            * <description> - a description of what should occur during this step in the guide
